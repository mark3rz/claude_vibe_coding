TASK 10B — Scenario Sliders + Tornado Chart

Continue working in dcf_dashboard.html.

SCOPE: - Implement interactive slider-based Scenario Builder. -
Implement tornado chart ranking sensitivity impact. - Do NOT modify
sensitivity tables from 10A.

REQUIREMENTS: 1) Add 7 sliders (WACC, Growth, Margin, Tax, CapEx,
Terminal Growth, Exit Multiple). 2) On slider change: - Update
state.inputs - Recalculate DCF (throttled) 3) Build tornado chart: -
Vary each key input by a small delta - Measure change in implied share
price - Rank impacts largest → smallest 4) Display live delta vs base
case in output panel.

PERFORMANCE RULES: - Throttle recalculation to prevent excessive
execution. - Destroy and recreate charts safely. - No full file
refactors.

DEFINITION OF DONE: - Sliders update valuation smoothly. - Tornado chart
reflects relative input sensitivity.
