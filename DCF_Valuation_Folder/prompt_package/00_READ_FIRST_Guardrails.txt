SONNET 4.6 CLAUDE CODE GUARDRAILS — READ FIRST

You are working inside an EXISTING single HTML file named
dcf_dashboard.html.

STRICT RULES: 1. Never rewrite the entire file. 2. Only modify sections
explicitly mentioned. 3. Do not refactor previously working logic unless
explicitly instructed. 4. Preserve all function names and signatures. 5.
If adding new logic, append it in clearly commented sections. 6. If
unsure, add TODO comments instead of rewriting architecture. 7. The app
must remain a SINGLE HTML FILE. 8. Do not introduce frameworks or
external build tools. 9. Keep changes incremental and localized. 10.
Output the FULL updated HTML file when finished.

If any instruction conflicts with existing working logic, prioritize
preserving working logic.
