You are a senior fintech product designer and front-end engineer.

Your task is to globally refactor and style the entire Capital IQ DCF learning tool to have a modern SaaS fintech aesthetic inspired by Stripe.

This is a professional financial product, but it should feel:
- Clean
- Elegant
- Airy
- Confident
- Minimal
- Intuitive
- Design-forward but not flashy

This should feel like:
- Stripe Dashboard
- Modern B2B fintech SaaS
- A well-funded startup valuation platform
- Institutional but accessible

Core Design Principles:
1. Light-first UI with optional dark mode toggle.
2. High whitespace usage.
3. Clean grid system.
4. Soft shadows and subtle depth.
5. Smooth spacing and alignment.
6. Clear visual hierarchy.
7. Typography-driven design.

Page Structure:

Charts:

Charts should feel like Stripe analytics:

- Clean legends.
- No heavy borders.
- Smooth transitions allowed but subtle.

Waterfall:

- Primary accent for positive impact.
- Muted grey for baseline.
- Clean labels aligned left.

Sensitivity Table:

- Avoid Excel-style harsh coloring.

Inputs:

Assumption Inputs:

WACC Section:

- Use subtle boxed containers.

DCF Table:

- Forecast visually emphasized.
- Terminal column lightly highlighted.
- FCFF row bold and slightly emphasized.

Explain Panel:

- Slide-out right panel.
- Light background with border.
- Clear headings.
- Short, crisp definitions.
- Formula rendered cleanly.
- Tone professional but approachable.

Micro-Interactions:

- Subtle hover states.
- Smooth transitions (not flashy).

- Primary buttons in accent color.
- Secondary buttons outlined.

Brand Tone:

- Feels trustworthy.
- Feels modern.
- Feels premium.
- No corporate stiffness.
- No dark institutional heaviness.
- No gamification.

Refactor Requirements:

- Centralize theme variables.
- Implement global style configuration.
- Ensure all charts inherit theme colors.
- Standardize number formatting.
- Standardize spacing scale.
- Improve visual hierarchy across:
  - Import page
  - Mapping page
  - Standardized Financials
  - DCF page
  - Sensitivity
  - Tornado
  - Waterfall
  - WACC explanation
  - Explain panel

Do not change business logic.
Only refactor styling, layout, formatting, spacing, and UI components.

The final result should look like a modern venture-backed fintech SaaS valuation platform.
