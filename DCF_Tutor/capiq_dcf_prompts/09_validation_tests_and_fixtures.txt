Add tests:
- test_clean_number: commas, parentheses negatives, blanks
- test_year_parsing: "2020 FY", "FY 2021", "2022E", "2023 Est", "12/31/2024"
- test_estimate_detection: headers with E/Est/Estimate flags
- test_dcf_math: small fixture with known PV checks
- test_terminal_value: both perpetuity and exit multiple
- test_ev_to_equity_bridge: check arithmetic and defaults

Add a simple synthetic fixture workbook generator:
- Create DataFrames shaped like Capital IQ statements with metric rows and year columns.
- Include a mix of actual and estimate headers.
- Write to xlsx in tests/tmp and ensure importer reads it.

Goal: enough tests to avoid demo-breaking regressions.
