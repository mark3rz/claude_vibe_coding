Write a short demo walkthrough script (for the mentor) and implement the learning layer.

Demo walkthrough (talk track):
1) Upload Capital IQ xlsx
2) Show Raw tabs to prove the app preserves exact data
3) Show Mapping confidence and standardized statements (IS/BS/CF/Multiples)
4) Go to DCF:
   - Pick Base scenario
   - Show EV, Equity, Price and the EV->Equity bridge waterfall
   - Change EBITDA margin and show all charts update
   - Show sensitivity table (WACC vs g)
   - Show tornado chart and explain biggest drivers
5) Scroll to WACC explanation section:
   - Show computed WACC inputs and formula
   - Compare computed WACC vs direct-input override

Explain-this content dictionary:
- For each assumption include:
  - definition
  - formula (LaTeX)
  - typical directionality (eg "Higher WACC reduces PV")
Keep text concise and educational.

Forecast start rule:
- Forecast begins after the LAST ACTUAL year (default). If "include estimates as history" is enabled, forecast begins after the last included year.
